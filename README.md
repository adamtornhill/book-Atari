# Programming Games for Atari 2600
*by Oscar Toledo G.*
*https://nanochess.org/*

All of the source code from my book *Programming Games for Atari 2600*.

There is a bonus program here *palette.asm* that displays the Atari 2600 palette, and a file *atari_palette.png* containing a reference of colors because the book is black and white.

### ERRATA FOR THE BOOK:

Currently none.

### NOTES:

These games are fully commented in my new book *Programming Games for Atari 2600*, including a crash course on 6507 programming!
